# Microsoft Azure training for researchers #

This repo provides training material for researchers and data scientists to learn how [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) can help to achieve faster, better and more reproducible research. There are individual modules covering a range of topics that can be worked through in a self-paced way. Each modules comprises a short slide deck that explains key concepts. A markdown file then contains a very detailed walkthrough, and required source and data files are also provided. 

Please feel free to use this material in your own courses and training. Do let us know if you do at [roa@microsoft.com](mailto:roa@microsoft.com)
