### Exercise 1: Understand Windows Azure Service Bus Queue and NCBI BLAST.  ###

#### What are Service Bus Queues? ####

Service Bus Queues support a **brokered messaging communication** model. When using queues, components of a distributed application do not communicate directly with each other, they instead exchange messages via a queue, which acts as an intermediary. A message producer (sender) hands off a message to the queue and then continues its processing. Asynchronously, a message consumer (receiver) pulls the message from the queue and processes it. The producer does not have to wait for a reply from the consumer in order to continue to process and send further messages. Queues offer **First In, First Out (FIFO)** message delivery to one or more competing consumers. That is, messages are typically received and processed by the receivers in the order in which they were added to the queue, and each message is received and processed by only one message consumer.

_Service Bus Queue Introduction_
 
Service Bus queues are a general-purpose technology that can be used for a wide variety of scenarios:

- Communication between web and worker roles in a multi-tier Windows Azure application.
- Communication between on-premises apps and Windows Azure hosted apps in a hybrid solution.
- Communication between components of a distributed application running on-premises in different organizations or departments of an organization.

In order to illustrate how to use Service Bus Queues, we also deploy the NCBI BLAST cloud service.

#### What is NCBI BLAST?####

The National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (NCBI BLAST) Sample demonstrates how to run a [nucleotide match algorithm](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) on the human genome using an HPC parametric sweep application.

The parametric sweep application uses a set of input files that contain sequences of nucleotides, comparing them to the human genome database. The application creates output files containing sequence similarities and uploads these files to a BLAST output visualizer (BOV) web site.

To run the nucleotide match, the sample uses the blastn utility, which is a part of the [BLAST+](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) application. 

The architecture of the sample and the steps of its execution are described:

![NCBI BLAST Architecture](images/blast-architecture.png)

_NCBI BLAST Architecture_

Architecture of the BLAST sample

1. The client application (browser) submits a parametric sweep job to the Web front-end via an AJAX call to the REST API.
1. The Web front-end pushes the job to a Service Bus queue.
1. A compute node gets the sweep job from the job queue and executes on it. The compute nodes are competing consumers of the job queue. This pattern allows us to scale out compute nodes as needed and ensures a submitted job is executed at least once.
1. The parametric sweep application running on a compute node downloads an input file from a Windows Azure blob storage. The input file includes a nucleotide that is to be compared to the human genome database previously downloaded to each Windows Azure compute node (a Worker Role instance).
1. After completing a sweep index, the BLAST application uploads the resulting matches file to the BLAST output visualization (BOV) web site and receives a matching URL for the file’s visualization page.
1. The output file and the URL are written to Windows Azure storage: the file is uploaded to a blob, and the URL is written in a table.
1. While the parametric sweep job is running, the compute node notifies the web front-end its progress via a SignalR channel. The web front-end then accesses the Windows Azure table storage to get updated URL list and shows it to the user.
1. The user can select any of the URLs to see the rendered image for the nucleotide match.

We have already an [NCBI BLAST web site](http://azure4research-blast.cloudapp.net/) deployed and you can just click to have a look. We've also created a sample service bus namespace **sb://sb-azure4research-blast.servicebus.windows.net/** and created a *JobQueue* under the namespace to manage our tasks.

1. Open the NCBI BLAST web site.

1. Because the system needs to download the database files, the very first task after the system has been deployed will take a long time. However, as the system caches database files, jobs after the first will be executed much faster. After several minutes, the task is finished.

### Exercise 2: Send a task to a Service Bus Queue from an IPython Notebook.  ###

Next we are going to use IPython Notebook to send a new task to the BLAST Cloud Service. You can find the sample code inside **Source\python_service_bus.py**

1. First we need to import required libraries:
```Python
from azure.servicebus import *
from azure.storage import *
import uuid
import random
import time
import json
```

    ![IPython Notebook Import Libraries](images/ipy-send-task-imports.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Import Libraries_


1. Run the following code to define credentials needed to interact with the Service Bus.
```Python
#define service namespace, account key and issuer
#we have already defined it for you
servicenamespace = 'sb-azure4research-blast'
accountkey = 'aC7HfbvW8t7+851wyCEI8DinXg2KTS1voDb2yqyUZZ8='
issuer = 'owner'
queue_name='JobQueue'
#create bus_service
bus_service = ServiceBusService(service_namespace=servicenamespace, account_key=accountkey, issuer=issuer)
```

    ![IPython Notebook Create Service Bus Service](images/ipy-send-task-bus-service.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Create Service Bus Service_	


1. Now we create a Python dictionary (`data`) to hold properties which define the inputs for the NCBI BLAST task that we want to execute. We use the `dumps` method of the `json` module to convert the dictionary into a JSON string and assign the JSON string to the `body` property of the message. The code randomly picks a file from 1 to 200 as the input file. In the example, we use *input_63* as the input file.
```Python
#create a new message
msg = Message()
id = str(uuid.uuid1()).replace('-','')
input_file = 'input_' + str(random.randint(1,200))
last_timestamp = int(time.time()*10000) + 621355968000000000
name = 'TEST ' + time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S", time.localtime()) + '(' + input_file + ')'
data = {'Hash': "",
        'Id': id,
        'InputFile': input_file,
        'InputFiles': "null",
        'LastMessage': "Queued",
        'LastTimestamp': last_timestamp,
        'Name': name,
        'OutputFile': "",
        'State': "QUEUED"
       }
s = json.dumps(data);
msg.body = json.dumps(data);
print msg.body
```

    ![IPython Notebook Create Message](images/ipy-send-task-create-message.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Create Message_

1. Before we submit the message to a Service Bus queue, we have to insert a new entity into a table first for the BLAST web site to track the status correctly. 
```Python
#insert the message to table first
account = 'blaststore'
key = '99serQiW4MXGx4u14SfZTiONYDZ5jn7BRgOcRsQEcY/WCgzJxWwoSCXSTmPQnXwoUJkrQPgDjrzIr5AO9q71/Q=='
table_name = 'SearchTask'
table_service = TableService(account_name=account, account_key=key)
entity = Entity()
entity.PartitionKey = data['Id']
entity.RowKey= data['Id']
entity.Id = data['Id']
entity.Name = data['Name']
entity.InputFile = data['InputFile']
entity.State = data['State']
entity.LastMessage = data['LastMessage']
entity.LastTimestamp = data['LastTimestamp']
table_service.insert_entity(table_name, entity)
```

    ![IPython Notebook Insert Table](images/ipy-send-task-insert-table.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Insert Table_

1. Finally we execute the following command to submit a message.
```Python
#submit the message to service bus queue
bus_service.send_queue_message(queue_name, msg)
```

    ![IPython Notebook Submit to Queue](images/ipy-send-task-submit-queue.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Submit to Queue_

1. Then let's navigate to the BLAST web site again, click **Refresh** button and check the new task. We can see a task with input file 63 is completed.

    ![New Task Complete](images/ipy-send-task-new-task-complete.png)
	
    _New Task Complete_

	You can do the same thing to check the hit sequences and HSP image as you did in [Exercise1](#Exercise1).

	Service Bus queues support a maximum message size of 256 KB (the header, which includes the standard and custom application properties, can have a maximum size of 64 KB). There is no limit on the number of messages held in a queue but there is a cap on the total size of the messages held by a queue. This queue size is defined at creation time, with an upper limit of 5 GB.

### Exercise 3: Receive a message from a Service Bus Queue.  ###

You can use Python to receive a message as well! Messages are received from a queue using the **receive_queue_message method** on the **ServiceBusService** object. 

1. Execute the following command to receive a message in IPython Notebook. If there is no message in the queue, IPython Notebook will block until either a message arrives or the thread times out. You can see **Kernel busy** on the top right.
```Python
#receive a new message
msgrec = bus_service.receive_queue_message(queue_name, False)
print msgrec.body 
```
    
    ![IPython Notebook Receive Message](images/ipy-receive-message.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Receive Message_

1. On the BLAST web site, click **New Task** twice to create 2 new tasks. Since we set the worker role to process only 1 task at one time, your IPython notebook can receive another message.

	>If there are multiple people using the BLAST service, just do the previous step as many times as needed until you receive a message.

    ![IPython Notebook Create Many New Tasks](images/ipy-create-multiple-msgs.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Create Many New Tasks_

1. If your IPython notebook receives a new message, then the message's body will be printed. 

    ![IPython Notebook Received New Message](images/ipy-received-new-message.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Received New Message_

1. Checking the web site again, we can see the task is stuck in **Queued** status because the message was read by IPython Notebook and BLAST will never see it.

    ![IPython Notebook Task Will NOT be Processed](images/ipy-task-not-processed.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Task Will NOT be Processed_

	Messages are deleted from the queue as they are read; however, you can read (peek) and lock the message without deleting it from the queue by setting the optional parameter peek_lock to True.

	The default behavior of reading and deleting the message as part of the receive operation is the simplest model, and works best for scenarios in which an application can tolerate not processing a message in the event of a failure. To understand this, consider a scenario in which the consumer issues the receive request and then crashes before processing it. Because Service Bus will have marked the message as being consumed, then when the application restarts and begins consuming messages again, it will have missed the message that was consumed prior to the crash.

	If the peek_lock parameter is set to True, the receive becomes a two stage operation, which makes it possible to support applications that cannot tolerate missing messages. When Service Bus receives a request, it finds the next message to be consumed, locks it to prevent other consumers receiving it, and then returns it to the application. After the application finishes processing the message (or stores it reliably for future processing), it completes the second stage of the receive process by calling the delete method on the Message object. The delete method will mark the message as being consumed and remove it from the queue.

1. Execute the following code.
```Python
#receive a new message when peek lock = True
msgrec = bus_service.receive_queue_message(queue_name, True)
print msgrec.body 
```
    
    ![IPython Notebook Receive Message With Peek Lock](images/ipy-receive-message-peek-lock.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Receive Message With Peek Lock_

1. By default the peek lock time is 30 seconds. After that, check the BLAST web site again, you will see the task is picked up by the default worker role and it is in *Completed* status:	

 	![IPython Notebook Message Processed Again](images/ipy-msg-processed-peek-lock-no-delete.png)
	
    _IPython Notebook Message Processed Again_

    If you use peek lock, you must remember to call **delete()** after you successfully processed the task.
